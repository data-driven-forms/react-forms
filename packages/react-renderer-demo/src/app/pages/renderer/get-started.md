## React form renderer

React form renderer is a component designed for ManageIQ and
Insights projects that takes json form definitions
and renders them into react components.
It uses [React final form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form) for the form state management.
It is highly recommended to check their documentations first to fully understand how
the [data-driven-forms](https://github.com/data-driven-forms/react-forms) libraries work.
