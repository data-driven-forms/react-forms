# Form Renderer

Form renderer is the core component of Data Driven Forms. It is used to generate and render forms.

```jsx
import { FormRenderer } from '@data-driven-forms/react-form-renderer';

const App = () => (<FormRenderer
  onSubmit={onSubmit}
  schema={schema}
  componentMapper={componentMapper}
  FormTemplate={FormTemplate}
/>)
```

## Required props

### componentMapper

*object*

Defines types of form field components. Field components can change the state of the form.

You can use [globally defined attributes](/mappers/global-component-props).

### FormTemplate

*Component*

**Note** You have to pass at least one of `FormTemplate` or a `children` render function to render the fields.
