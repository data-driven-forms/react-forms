## Common select features

This mapper component is using the common select component to provide additional features.

## loadOptions

*(currentSearchValue: string) => Promise< Options >*

Using `loadOptions` function you can dynamically load options when the component is mounted or when the value in search bar is changed. You can also trigger a reload via changing `loadOptionsChangeCounter` *number* attribute.

## selectAll

When provided to an option object, this option will select all available options.

```jsx
options: [{
        label: 'Select all',
        value: 'select-all',
        selectAll: true,
    },
    ...
    ]
```

## selectNone

```jsx
options: [{
        label: 'Select none',

        selectNone: true,
    },
    ...
    ]
