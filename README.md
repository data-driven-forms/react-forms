Data Driven Forms is a React library used for rendering and managing forms with a lot of provided features based on [React Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form).


:question: Why to use Data Driven Forms? :question:
- All forms shared the same functionality!
- Components are controlled in one place!
- You can easily migrate to different sets of components!
- All functionality is provided (see below!)

:tada: Features :tada:
- Easily readable schema, you don't need to know any HTML or JS to be able to write your own form schemas!
- You can use your own components or use one of our provided mappers ([PatternFly 3](https://patternfly-react.surge.sh/patternfly-3/index.html), [PatternFly 4](https://patternfly-react.surge.sh/patternfly-4/) or [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)!)
- Form state managing out-of-the-box (including error states!)
- Fully customizable (you can use your own buttons, actions, etc.)!
- Conditional fields!
- Custom field validation with basic set included!
- Datatype validation!
- Cross-field validation!
- Asynchronous validation supported!
- Supporting Wizard forms!
- Supporting Mozzila form schema!
- Supporting [Final Form Field Array](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form-arrays)!
- ... and a lot more!

### Installation

You neet to add React Form Renderer

#### [React Form Renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@data-driven-forms/react-form-renderer)

```console
$ npm install @data-driven-forms/react-form-renderer -S
```

```console
$ yarn add @data-driven-forms/react-form-renderer
```

Optionally you can install one of provided mappers:

#### [PatternFly 3 Mapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@data-driven-forms/pf3-component-mapper)

```console
$ npm install @data-driven-forms/pf3-component-mapper -S
```

```console
$ yarn add @data-driven-forms/pf3-component-mapper
```

#### [PatternFly 4 Mapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@data-driven-forms/pf4-component-mapper)

```console
$ npm install @data-driven-forms/pf4-component-mapper -S
```

```console
$ yarn add @data-driven-forms/pf4-component-mapper
```

#### [Material-UI Mapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@data-driven-forms/mui-component-mapper)

```console
$ npm install @data-driven-forms/mui-component-mapper -S
```

```console
$ yarn add @data-driven-forms/mui-component-mapper
```

### Usage

For using Data Driven Forms in your component you need the renderer and a component mapper, which provides formFields components and layoutFields components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import FormRenderer, { componentTypes } from '@data-driven-forms/react-form-renderer';
import { formFieldsMapper, layoutMapper } from '@data-driven-forms/pf4-component-mapper';

const schema = {
  fields: [{
    component: componentTypes.TEXT_FIELD,
    name: 'name',
    label: 'Your name'
  }]
}

const Form = () => (
  <FormRenderer
    schema={schema}
    formFieldsMapper={formFieldsMapper}
    layoutMapper={layoutMapper}
    onSubmit={console.log}
  />
)
```

### Basic provided components

Data Driven Forms supports all kinds of component, basic set is consisted of:

- Text input
- Text area
- Checkbox (Multiple checkboxes)
- Select (dropdown)

### Development setup

Data Driven Forms is a monorepo which uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), so you can use all its commands as well.

1. Install

```console
yarn install
```

2. Build

```console
yarn build
```

3. Run a package

Each package has a small playground `package/demo`, where you can test your changes.

```console
cd packages/pf3-component-mapper
yarn start
```

4. How to clean?

```console
rm yarn.lock
yarn lerna clean # will delete all node_modules
```

All packages are linked together by default, so if you run a `yarn build` in a package, all other packages are updated to the latest version of that package.

#### Tests

Tests needed to be run from the core folder.

```console
yarn test

yarn test packages/pf3-component-mapper
```

#### Commits

Data Driven Forms uses [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer)

Format:

```
[type]([package]): message

fix(pf3): title accepts node
```

Types:
- `feat`: a new feature, will trigger new `_.X._` release
- `fix`: a fix, will trigger new `_._.X` release

Packages:
- Please describe which package is being changed `pf3`, `renderer`, ...

Please, do not use Semantic Release, if you update only the demo.

All packages are releasing together and they share the version number.

#### Changes to documentation

If your changes influence API or add new features, you should describe these new options in the `demo` repository. Thanks!
